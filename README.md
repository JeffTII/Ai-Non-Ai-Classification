# Ai-Non-Ai-Classification
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify whether an uploaded photo is AI-generated or not. The model is built using TensorFlow and employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy in differentiating between AI and non-AI images.
